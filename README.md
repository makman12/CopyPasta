# CopyPasta

CopyPasta is a VSCode extension that allows you to copy paste the code section of the first answer to your programming related question from Stack Overflow.

## Usage and features

In your text editor just write what you would normally search on Google, then press `CTRL + Enter` and you will get what you want. You don't have to add name of the language you are writing on because it will be automatically added.

Currently there three advanced options;

-   If you add `-s` to the end of the query sentence it will open the page for you.

    -   If you just write `-s` and press `CTRL + Enter` it will open the page for your last search.

-   If you add `-l` to the end of the query sentence it will open a quicklist with all the code snippets from the result.

    -   If you just write `-l` and press `CTRL + Enter` it will open the list for your last search.

-   If you just write a number, it will get that snippet from your last search.

    -   If you write `-g` add the end of the query and it will get that result.

-   The command will bring you the code snippet of the first comment. If you want to see the snippets for other anwsers you can just type the index of the comment (ie. `2`), and it will fetch the code snippet of that anwser from your last search.

Obviously if you have specific problems you should check them out by yourself, but if you just wanna know what syntax to use CopyPasta is your helper.
